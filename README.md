# Odyssey
After their spaceship crashed onto an unknown planet, the player wakes up as the only survivor. The ship took some damage, unable to fly, but some of the reserved fuel rods powering the ship have scattered across the planet. 

As the player ventures outside the ship cautiously with their standard issue firearm, they discover there are hostile creatures lurking amongst the land. Bring the cubic fuel rods back to the ship and drop it to the lighted up square before oxygen runs out!

Note, the firearm runs on oxygen which makes reloading unecessary. But shoot sparingly - your oxygen levels will go down considerably.

You are not expected to survive.
