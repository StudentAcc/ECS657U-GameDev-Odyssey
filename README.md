# Odyssey
After your spaceship crashed onto an unknown planet, you wake up as the only survivor. The ship took some damage, unable to fly, but some of the oxygen tanks as well as the ship parts powering the ship have scattered across the planet.

As you venture outside the ship cautiously with your standard issue firearm, you discover there are hostile creatures lurking amongst the land. Find and collect the ship parts back to the ship before oxygen runs out! Don't forget, there are oxygen tanks from the ship's debris to increase your oxygen levels...

Note, the firearm runs on oxygen which makes reloading unecessary. But shoot sparingly - your oxygen levels will go down considerably.

You are not expected to survive.
